# Transient-Holocene-AMOC
This repository holds the data that used for plotting the figures in the paper.
The Folder 'Original_max_amoc_30n_data' has all the original data for the maximum AMOC strength at 30N below 500m for each transient run. The CCSM3 and IPSL runs provide decdal data. All other runs provide annual data.
The remaining folders have the data which can be download to reproduce the Fig 1, 2,3,4 in this paper: 
(1) Folder 'max_AMOC_30n' provides smoothed time series data for the maximum AMOC at 30N (100-yr running mean), 
(2) Folder 'spatial_pattern_for_trend' provides (i) the trend of the AMOC strength at each grid box (6ka --present, unit:Sv/kyr), (ii) the 6-0 ka mean AMOC (shown as contours in Fig 2)
(3) Folder 'AMOC_30n_std_dev' provides the time series of the 100-yr running standard deviation of the maximum AMOC at 30N (7ka -- present) 
(4) Folder 'Ensemble_mean_AMOC_and_Recon_AMOC' provides data for plotting Fig 4a,b,c and d, respectively. It includes the time series for the ensemble mean AMOC at 30N (6ka --present) (z-score) and time series for the reconstructed AMOC (z_score) (Osman et al. (2021), Lippold et al. (2019), Ritz et al. (2013))
