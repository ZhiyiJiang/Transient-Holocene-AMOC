This repository holds the data that used for plotting the figures in the paper.
The Folder 'Original(1) timeseries for the maximum AMOC at 30N (100-yr running mean), (2) timeseries for the standard deviation of AMOC at 30N (7ka -- present) (based on a 100-yr sliding window) (3) AMOC spatial pattern for trends (6ka --present, unit:Sv/kyr) (4) timeseries for the ensemble mean AMOC at 30N (6ka --present) (z-score), timeseries for the reconstructed AMOC (z_score)
